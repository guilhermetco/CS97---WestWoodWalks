This Django example shows how to create json files in web queries,
how to link tables together, and how to populate a database from
a fixture file.

Installation:

This demo should be ready to go.

If you have Django installed you can run like this 

python3 manage.py runserver

Then view on http://localhost:8000

This demo comes with a preconfigured sqlite server.  You should not need
to run any migrations, but if you do, here's how:

python3 manage.py migrate

To create fixtures from JSON images:
In javascript: myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
In Python/Django you can get json for apps locations and snippets:

python3 django-admin dumpdata locations
python3 django-admin dumpdata snippets

Save in fixtures folders as:

locations/fixtures/load_locations.json 
snippets/fixtures/load_snippets.json

Load with:
python3 manage.py loaddata load_locations.json
python3 manage.py loaddata load_snippets.json

The references are worth reading and explain everything.
