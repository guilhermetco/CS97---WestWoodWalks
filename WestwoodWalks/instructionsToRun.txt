How to run the app locally

What you need to have installed before:
1) Node.js 
    link to installation: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Expo CLI
    command to install: "npm install -g expo-cli"

Once you have those installed:
1) Go to your terminal and enter the WestwoodWalks directory.
2) Run "npm install." This is needed because the node-modules are not uploaded
   to Github since there are so many. This will download all the modules needed.
3) Run "expo start"
4) This should run the app  
    - I recommend downloading the Expo Go App so you can view the
      app on your phone. You just need to scan the QR code.
